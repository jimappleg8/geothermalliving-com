Geothermal heating and cooling is an important technology, and it needs more advocates. It needs people yelling its praises from the rooftops. It needs banks designing special financing plans. It needs some traction!

Solar and wind energy get a lot more attention, and it’s because they’re sexier. They’re the sports cars of renewable energy: high-tech, flashy and sleek. They’re a status symbol, and they make a statement.

Ground-source heat pump systems are more like the mid-sized economy cars of renewable energy. They’re efficient, reliable and unassuming. They’re invisible and quiet, so they don’t draw attention to themselves. They don’t announce to the neighborhood that you’re helping save the planet.

Let’s face it, they consist of underground pipes and what looks like a furnace. It’s hard to make that look exciting on a magazine cover.

Yet, they are among the most efficient and reliable renewable energy technologies out there! Especially for heating and cooling your home. They deserve better!

## Spreading the word

The other night, I did an informal poll with the other parents in my son’s Cub Scout den. Have you or do you know anyone who has installed a geothermal heat pump in their house? The result was a room of blank faces and then a few comments about Iceland. Iceland is famous for powering their entire country using geothermal power generation plants. No one had heard about ground source heat pumps at all.

So what’s the deal? There are plenty of other websites talking about geothermal heating and cooling. Why is it still such a well-kept secret?

I have a theory.

The geothermal industry is still learning how to reach out to you, the consumer.

For decades, geothermal has been a niche market. People interested in the technology have always sought out the contractors. Word of mouth was the main marketing tool used.

With today’s energy situation and climate change, we need geothermal more than ever. For the industry to grow, it needs to become more mainstream. And to do that, we will need to do a better job of showing the world why it’s awesome.

That is part of the intent of Geothermal Living. I want to introduce people to geothermal heating and cooling. I want them to love it and pass the information on to their friends. I want the word to spread.

## Everything you need

I also want to create a great place for you to come when you want more information. And I want Geothermal Living to be there for you no matter where you are in the process:

Just getting started? We’ve got you covered with accurate information.
Looking for a contractor? We can help ensure that you get the best one in the area.
Having trouble with an installed system? We can help you iron out the kinks.
Can’t find the answer to your question? We’ll work to find the answer and get it added to the site.

## Unbiased and complete

As well-intentioned as they are, most of the geothermal heat pump websites out there have an agenda. They want to sell you something. I’m not knocking that, but it does make you wonder if you’re getting the whole story.

Here’s what I mean.

The existing websites tend to fall into one of four categories:

1. small companies trying to sell installation services
2. manufacturers trying to sell heat pumps and related equipment
3. organizations supporting the geothermal industry
4. government agencies

I want Geothermal Living to be a fifth kind of website: an unbiased consumer advocate.

## Accurate and original

These sites have a lot of good information. In fact, as you read them you’ll start to notice they have a lot of the same information.

Look up any of the following phrases in Google. You’ll find a bunch of sites that seem to have copied each other:

- “The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have both endorsed ground source heat pump systems as among the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly heating, cooling, and water heating systems available.”
- “The ground absorbs nearly half of the solar energy our planet receives.”
- “It is believed that the ultimate source of geothermal energy is radioactive decay occurring deep within the earth (Burkland, 1973).”

(By the way, I would love to read the article by Burkland referenced in the third quote. Please point me to it if you can.)

I want Geothermal Living to get past the boilerplate information and give you the complete information.

## So to summarize…

I intend for Geothermal Living to be the most accurate, unbiased and complete guide to better living through geothermal heating and cooling.

Sincerely,
Jim Applegate
