Hi, I’m Jim and I’m the guy behind Geothermal Living. I have a Bachelors of Environmental Design (B.Envd) from the University of Colorado, a job as a web developer, and a strong interest in technologies that help create a world that works for everyone.

Geothermal heating and cooling systems are one of those technologies. They use the natural temperature stability in the soil below the frost line to make heating and cooling more efficient. The heat energy stored in the soil is maintained by the Sun, or so I’m told, and that helps humanity live within our “energy income” as Buckminster Fuller called it.

I became interested in geothermal heating and cooling systems after my in-laws had a system installed in their Minneapolis home.
