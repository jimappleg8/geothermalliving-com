If have a geothermal heating and cooling system, and you’re not particularly happy with how it’s performing, there are steps you can take to improve things. 

## Tip 1: Take ownership of the problem

I believe that even if your heat pump is still under the manufacture’s warranty and your installer is fixing the system for free, you still need to own the problem.

By that I mean that you should not just count on your installer to figure out what’s wrong and fix it. If the issue is an installation error, it may be that your installer is too inexperienced to know how to fix it. If he knew, the error might never have been made. Or if the problem is something fundamental related to the design, they may be very reluctant to admit it because it could end up being very costly to their company. 

Do your best to understand how your system works and what the symptoms you’re experiencing might mean. For example, if the compressor pump in your heat pump keeps burning out, it could be that your loop field is undersized. On the other hand, if your heat pump seems to be struggling to keep up on cold days, that might be an expected behavior and nothing to worry about. 

Also, take an honest look at other factors, unrelated to the ground-source heat pump system, that might be affecting your efficiencies. Are you leaving windows open in the winter for fresh air? Are your heating vents covered up with dirty clothes? Is you house just draftier than it was assumed to be when they did the load analysis? Geothermal heat pumps are amazing, but they can’t do miracles.

## Tip 2: Read your installation manual

This suggestion might make you think “why do I need to do their job?”

Fair enough, but reading your heat pump’s installation manual is a great way to get familiar with that big box in the basement. I’m assuming that you’ve already read the owner’s manual.

Read your installation manual in the basement or wherever the system is installed. As you read each section, take a look at your heat pump and ask yourself “does that look like it was done correctly?” You might be surprised at what you find.

For example, a complaint that I have seen a lot in forums is that their heat pump is noisy and they can hear it vibrating through the vent system. Heat pumps do vibrate because of the compressor pump, but you should not hear it throughout the house.

If you look through the installation manual, you’ll see that the manufacturer recommends that you isolate the heat pump by installing a strip of flexible canvas where the heat pump connects to the vents. That way the vibration is not transferred to the vents. If your installer has lots of furnace installation experience but little heat pump experience, he might forget this step. Furnaces generally don’t vibrate, so this kind of flexible connection is not required.

Don’t have the installation manual? All the heat pump manufacturers make their installation manuals available online so you can download them and print them out if you’d like. You can get a complete list of manufacturers and links to their manuals by visiting our Heat Pump Manufacturers page.

If you find these kinds of installation mistakes, it will be hard for your installer to argue about fixing them. And these kinds of details might make all the difference in your satisfaction with the system.

## Tip 3: Install a wifi thermostat

A wifi thermostat like the Ecobee can be a great tool in analyzing how your system is working. It can keep a log of your system’s activity so you (or your repairman) can get a better sense of how the system is behaving and under what conditions. 

A wifi thermostat can also send you a notice via text or email if your backup heating is on too long. With a traditional thermostat, you may not know until you get a crazy-high electric bill that there is a problem. 

## Tip 4: Buy a full monitoring system

You can buy a monitor with a series of sensors that will tell you exactly what is happening in your system. A thermostat can tell you how your heat pump is responding to certain conditions, but a monitoring system can tell you exactly how each part of your system is performing. Are you getting enough heat from the loop field?  Are the loop pumps providing water at a high enough pressure for the heat pump to operate efficiently?

These kinds of things can really help you or your HVAC guy figure out how to tweak the system and keep it working at optimal efficiency. 

## Tip 5: Get help from a third party

If your HVAC company is not solving the problem, see if you can some impartial help. The heat pump manufacturer will probably not give you help except through the affiliate HVAC dealer, but you could call another approved installer in a different city and ask for a consultation. You might be able to describe your problems and send them pictures of your setup, along with any thermostat or monitoring logs and see if they can provide some recommendations. Being in a different city, they won’t be competing with you current HVAC company for your business and you’ll likely get good impartial information that you or your HVAC company can act on.
