I started writing this post when I read this sentence on energy.gov:

Be sure to find a qualified installer.

As with so many of these statements, I immediately thought to myself “how do I do that?” And so this post was born.

## There may be more than one

A system like a geothermal heating and cooling system is complex and will probably require more than one contractor to complete. If you’re installing a vertical loop, you will need a well drilling company to drill your vertical loop shafts. You may need a general contractor to dig the trenches that are needed to run the lines back to your building. Then you’ll probably need an HVAC contractor to install the heat pump and take care of any ducting that needs to be fixed or installed.

But that doesn’t mean you have to be the one that manages all these contractors. If you start with the HVAC contractor, you will likely find that they have relationships with well drillers, general contractors, electricians, and others that they can bring in to do the various aspects of the job. Depending on your area, you may find a well driller that specializes in geothermal shaft drilling and they may act as the general contractor. Just make sure the main contractor takes responsibility if anything goes wrong with any of their subcontractors.

## Find someone who has been trained

To get a list of qualifies contractors in your area, search the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA) directory or the Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium directory. The IGSHPA directory lists contractors that are accredited by them, where the Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium directory lists their members.

## Ask for References

When you’re interviewing contractors to install your geothermal heating and cooling system, ask for the names and phone number of people they have installed systems for over the last several years. You want to talk to some people who have lived with their system for several seasons. And make sure you call them.
