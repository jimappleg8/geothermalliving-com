If you are new to geothermal heating and cooling, these are the basics you need to understand. It’s not all that complicated, but like anything that is new to you, it helps to know the fundamentals.

## What do we mean by geothermal?

Geothermal means “heat from the Earth” and there are three broad categories of technologies we use to make use of Earth’s heat: geothermal power generation, direct use, and ground source heat pump systems.

- **Geothermal Power.** Systems that drill into hot spot in Earth’s crust and use the heat energy to generate electricity. These kinds of facilities are large-scale projects, and are not for residential heating. 
- **Direct Use.** Systems that use Earth-heated water directly. This is the oldest use of Geothermal heat. A good example of this is the swimming pool in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, which is built around a hot springs.
- **Ground Source Heat Pump Systems.** Systems that use the relatively consistent soil temperatures starting about ten feet below the surface to heat and cool a building with high efficiency.

This site is concerned exclusively with the third category: ground source heat pump systems.

## What are they called again?

The systems that heat and cool a building using the relatively stable temperatures a few feet under the surface go by a number of names, but they all mean essentially the same thing:

- Geothermal Heating
- Geothermal Heat Pumps (GHPs)
- Ground-Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs)
- Water Source Heat Pumps
- Geoexchange
- Green Heat

You will also hear “geothermal energy” used to describe the systems, but that term should be reserved for geothermal power generation. 

## Geothermal heating and cooling systems

A geothermal heating and cooling system has three main components:

1. The ground loop which is where water or some other liquid is used to extract to store heat in the soil, depending on whether you are trying to heat or cool.
2. The heat pump which does most of the actual work of heating and cooling.
3. The distribution system on the house. For example, the duct work for a forced-air system or the copper pipes for a radiator system.

## Types of ground loops

There are two primary ways to build a ground loop: horizontally or vertically.

To build a horizontal ground loop, a contractor digs trenches eight to ten feet deep, lays pipe in it, and covers it back up. It is generally less expensive than vertical loops, but it will pretty much destroy your yard. If you are building new, then that is less of a concern.

To build a vertical ground loop, a drilling company will drill boreholes up to 300 feet vertically into the ground. Two pipes joined at the end with a U-shaped fitting are then lowered into the borehole, and grout is used to fill in the rest of the hole.

## Scalability

Geothermal systems can scale from very small (1 ton with a small loop) to very large (dozens of tons with very large loops). Manufacturers make heat pumps of different sizes. If you need more capacity than one heat pump can provide, you simply use two or more.
