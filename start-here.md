Welcome to Geothermal Living! I assume you’re on this page because you’re new to our site. Thank you for coming!

## Not yet ready for prime time

We intend to make Geothermal Living the place to come to discover how to live better through geothermal heating and cooling.

We’re… um… not quite there yet.

If you’re reading this, then you have found our site before it’s official launch date. But that can be a good thing! You’re getting in on the ground floor (or even the basement) and you can have an effect on what this site becomes.

I have two invitations for you:

1. **Subscribe to our newsletter list** and we will send you updates as we complete articles and add new content. Be the first to know what we are doing! We’ll also let you know when we officially launch the site!
2. Help define what Geothermal Living becomes! **Leave comments below** or send us an email. Tell us what you want to see. What questions do you have? What challenges are you facing?

We hope you enjoy the small amount of information that we have so far. And we hope you stay with us as we grow.

Sincerely,
Jim Applegate
